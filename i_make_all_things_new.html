            <h2>I Make All Things New</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;Saint Paul quoting Habakkuk says: “Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish, for I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, if any man shall tell it to you” <i>(Ac 13:41)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Jesus said: “Behold, I make all things new” <i>(Apoc 21:5)</i>, and ‘all things’ means ‘ALL THINGS,’ including all religions of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;“Eternal” as Jesus said at the Last Supper: This is My Body <i>(Lk 22:19)</i> This is the Chalice of My Blood <i>(Lk 22:20)</i> Of the New and Eternal Testament <i>(Mk 14:24; 1Jn 5:11)</i>. “Virgin” as St. Paul said: “…that I may present you as a Chaste Virgin to Christ” <i>(2Co 11:2)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Who is this ‘chaste virgin’? “I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters and as the voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps, and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth. These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goes. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth there was found no lie, for they are without spot before the throne of God” <i>(Apoc 14:2-5)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The Eucharistic Reign of Christ on earth ushers in “ALL THINGS NEW.”
