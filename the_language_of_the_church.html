            <h2>The Language Of The Church</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;Initially the Church will speak in all the languages and dialects of the world, using the example of the language on the Cross: “It was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin” <i>(Jn 19:20)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The Apostles “were all filled with the Holy Ghost: and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak… we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God” <i>(Ac 2:4,8-11)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;St. Paul says: “I thank my God I speak with all your tongues” <i>(1Co 14:18)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;It is also written in the Apocalypse: “…the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans” <i>(Apoc 9:11)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The necessity of having the Word of God in every language on earth is self evident from Holy Scripture. There are those who would like to pray in the original tongues of Hebrew, Greek or Latin – wonderful, but do not restrict nations from praying and celebrating in their native language. Christ is King of all nations and tongues!
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;In the Calendar of the Saints it is recorded that SS. Cyril, monk, and Methodius, Bishop, and Confessors, were brothers, born at Salonika and educated at Constantinople. They were sent as missionaries to Moravia. They translated the Sacred Scriptures into the Slavonic language and were the first to devise and use the Slavonic alphabet. They went to Rome, and obtained approval of the Pope for their mission and their practice of using the Slavonic language in the sacred liturgy.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The Church is the Church of All Nations and tongues. These languages of all the nations will continue to be spoken until “the scattering of the band of the holy people shall be accomplished, all these things shall be finished” (Dn 12:7). When all things are finished and in place which God has ordained, the whole world will speak in the New Tongue, the Heavenly Language – all things are made new!
