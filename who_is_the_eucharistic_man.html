            <h2>Who Is The Eucharistic Man?</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;“You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you.” <i>(Jn 15:16)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;As the Man Jesus Christ carried His Cross to Calvary, and from the Cross, gave His Divinity ‘Christ’ into the hands of His Father saying: “Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit” <i>(Lk 23:46)</i>, it was the old man Jesus Who died, and it was the New Man the New Creation Christ Jesus Who rose from the dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The old man Jesus Christ was no more, the New Man Christ Jesus arose and is the fulfilment of Holy Eucharist.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Saint Paul confirms Eucharistic Man: “…may we in all things grow up in Him, Who is the Head <i>(Ep 4:15)</i>, walk in newness of life, in the likeness of His resurrection <i>(Rm 6:4,5)</i>, to perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ” <i>(Ep 4:13)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;This is the arrival of Eucharistic man, and it is Eucharistic man, one in Christ Jesus, who brings to completion the desire of God: “Let us make man to Our image and likeness… And God created man to His Own image: to the image of God He created him, male and female He created them” <i>(Gn 1:26,27)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;God made man in the beginning to His image (not likeness), in Christ Jesus man is made to God’s likeness too. Jesus said: “My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, that I may perfect His work” <i>(Jn 4:34)</i>. Through Holy Eucharist, Eucharist man comes into that perfection of His work.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Our Blessed Mother in Her Apparitions and locutions tells us: “Less and less importance is being given to the Eucharist.” Why? It is through Holy Eucharist that Eucharistic man becomes the new creature: “If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new” <i>(2Co 5:17)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Eucharistic man inflicts the final defeat on Satan and puts him in Hell for all eternity.
